# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the “Built with ❤️ using caffeine.ai” attribution line from the home/landing page footer while keeping the rest of the footer intact.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the “Built with” / “created by” / “caffeine.ai” attribution text and link from the home (landing) screen footer only.
- Adjust footer spacing/layout so the remaining items (e.g., Privacy Policy link, copyright) stay well-spaced with no awkward gap.

**User-visible outcome:** On the home/landing screen, users no longer see any caffeine.ai attribution in the footer, and the Privacy Policy link remains available and works as before.
